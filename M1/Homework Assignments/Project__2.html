             Education is the <mark>process of learning</mark>. This process can be <i>more simplified and more effective</i> with computers.
              Many computer based educational software are available for students. These softwares help them to<b><i> learn,
                read, count or to speak a foreign language.</i></b> <br> Following are the fields of education where
                computer technology is usually used :</p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.</b> <small>Computer-Aided Learning (CAL)<br>

            <p><b>Airline System :</b></p>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             In airline systems, computers are used to <b><i>control passenger aircraft</i></b>. Early aircraft were
              <mark>controlled by mechanical systems</mark>. 
            In the modern aircraft, a <em>fly-by-wire system</em> is used. In this system, <mark>electronic signals from the
             cockpit are sent that adjust the
         flight surfaces</mark>. The computer in the pilot's control is <b>linked up among different cities and gives full information about flights 
        and seat reservations.</b></p>

        <p><b>Weather Forecasting :</b></p>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Weather Forecasting is a <b>process of predicting the weather</b>. Computers are used to make this process more <del>precise</del> <i><b>accurate</b></i>. 
             Weather forecasting depends on the accurate collection of data. Data is collected from different areas of the world. 
             The computer makes a model based on a lot of <i>factors</i> like <b><i>air, humidity and temperature</i></b>. When data is given to this model 
             it generates a <i>forecast</i> of how the weather will change. This forecast cannot be 100% accurate.<br> Some businesses are very
             dependent on the weather and they need constantly updated information. <br><mark><b><i>SUPARCO
                 (Space And Upper Atmosphere Research Commission) </mark></i></b>weather forecasting department offers analysis of live
                  weather data and provides help to make business decisions based on weather forecasting.</p>
            
                  <p><b>Home :</b></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At home, computers are used to <i><b>play games, surf the internet, watch movies and listen to music</b></i>. All these things
                can be done using a single computer. It is a <i>cheaper and easier solution</i>. People also use computers to keep their <mark>daily expense 
                and make home budgets</mark>. <br>The use of microprocessor technology in the manufacturing of electronic home appliances like microwaves, 
                air conditioning, washing machines, sewing machines, etc. has completely changed our way of life.</p>
