                <small class="text-muted">Aligot <b>(Occitan: Alig√≤t)</b> is a dish made from cheese blended into 
                    mashed potatoes (often with some garlic) that is made in <b>L'Aubrac (Aveyron, Cantal, 
                    Loz√®re) region</b> in the <b>southern Massif Central of France</b>. This fondue-like dish from the 
                    Aveyron department is a common sight in Auvergne restaurants.</small>

                <small class="text-muted">Traditionally made with the Tomme de Laguiole (Tomme fra√Æche), or 
                    Tomme d'Auvergne cheese, aligot is an Occitan speciality highly appreciated in the local 
                    gastronomy with Toulouse sausages or roast pork. Other cheeses are also used in place of 
                    Tomme, including Cantal, mozzarella and Laguiole. The choice of cheese is important, and 
                    strongly affects the result. Tomme is not easily available outside France; many other 
                    cheeses are reported to be too strong. The cheese must be mild, with a lactic tang, but 
                    not too much salt, and melt easily. A comparison of the cheeses available in the UK found 
                    creamy (rather than the crumbly variety) Lancashire to be best, rejecting most other 
                    suggestions; other cheeses will be needed where neither Tomme nor Lancashire are available. 
                    Floury, rather than waxy, potatoes are preferable.</small>

                <small class="text-muted">Aligot is made from <mark>mashed potatoes blended with butter, cream, 
                    crushed garlic, and melted cheese</mark>. The dish is ready when it develops a smooth, elastic 
                    texture. While recipes vary, the Larousse Gastronomique gives the ingredients as 1 kg 
                    potatoes; 500 g tomme fra√Æche, Laguiole, or Cantal cheese; 2 garlic cloves; 30 g butter; 
                    salt and pepper.</small>
