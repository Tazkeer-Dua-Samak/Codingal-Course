Modern AUs: Something Real (wrong number/texting AU) and An Apple a Day (medical AU) are top-tier choices for non-cultivation settings.
Humour: save a sword, ride a socialist by sysrae is frequently cited for its hilarity and unique take on the setting.
Time Travel/De-aging: An Arrow Through Time and various de-aging fics where Lan Wangji has to care for a child version of Wei Wuxian are fan staples.
