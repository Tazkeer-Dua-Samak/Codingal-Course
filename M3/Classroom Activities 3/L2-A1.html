                <small class="text-muted">The modern newspaper is a European invention. The oldest direct 
                    handwritten news sheets circulated widely in Venice as early as 1566. These weekly news 
                    sheets were full of information on wars and politics in Italy and Europe. The first printed 
                    newspapers were published weekly in Germany from 1605. Typically, they were censored by 
                    the government, especially in France, and reported mostly foreign news and current prices. 
                    After the English government relaxed censorship in 1695, newspapers flourished in London and 
                    a few other cities including Boston and Philadelphia. By the 1830s, high-speed presses could 
                    print thousands of papers cheaply, allowing low daily costs.</small>
