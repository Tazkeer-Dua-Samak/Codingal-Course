                        The cat (Felis catus), also referred to as the domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated
                        carnivorous mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae. Advances in archaeology
                        and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. 
                        It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact.
                        It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted
                        to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and
                        sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary
                        hunter and a crepuscular predator.

                    Cat intelligence is evident in their ability to adapt, learn through observation, and solve problems, with research
                    showing they possess strong memories, exhibit neuroplasticity, and display cognitive skills comparable to a young child.
                    Cat communication includes meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, grunting, and body language. It can hear sounds
                    too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.
