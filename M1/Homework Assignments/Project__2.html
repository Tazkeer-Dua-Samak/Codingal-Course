             Education is the process of learning. This process can be more simplified and more effective with computers.
              Many computer based educational software are available for students. These softwares help them to learn,
               read, count or to speak a foreign language. <br> Following are the fields of education where
                computer technology is usually used :</p>
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>1.</b> <small>Computer-Aided Learning (CAL)<br>

            <p><b>Airline System :</b></p>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             In airline systems, computers are used to control passenger aircraft. Early aircraft were controlled by mechanical systems. 
            In the modern aircraft, a fly-by-wire system is used. In this system, electronic signals from the cockpit are sent that adjust the
         flight surfaces. The computer in the pilot's control is linked up among different cities and gives full information about flights 
        and seat reservations.</p>

        <p><b>Weather Forecasting :</b></p>
             <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
             Weather Forecasting is a process of predicting the weather. Computers are used to make this process more accurate. 
             Weather forecasting depends on the accurate collection of data. Data is collected from different areas of the world. 
             The computer makes a model based on a lot of factors like air, humidity and temperature. When data is given to this model 
             it generates a forecast of how the weather will change. This forecast cannot be 100% accurate.<br> Some businesses are very
             dependent on the weather and they need constantly updated information. <br><b><i>SUPARCO
                 (Space And Upper Atmosphere Research Commission)</i></b>weather forecasting department offers analysis of live
                  weather data and provides help to make business decisions based on weather forecasting.</p>
            
                  <p><b>Home :</b></p>
                  <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                     &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
                At home, computers are used to play games, surf the internet, watch movies and listen to music. All these things
             can be done using a single computer. It is a cheaper and easier solution. People also use computers to keep their daily expense 
            and make home budgets. <br>The use of microprocessor technology in the manufacturing of electronic home appliances like microwaves, 
        air conditioning, washing machines, sewing machines, etc. has completely changed our way of life.</p>

        <blockquote cite="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer#Professions_and_organizations">As the use of computers has spread throughout
             society, there are an increasing number of careers involving computers.

            Computer-related professions
            Hardware-related	Electrical engineering, Electronic engineering, Computer engineering, Telecommunications engineering, Optical engineering, Nanoengineering
            Software-related	Computer science, Computer engineering, Desktop publishing, Humanâ€“computer interaction, Information technology, Information systems, Computational science, Software engineering, Video game industry, Web design
            The need for computers to work well together and to be able to exchange information has
             spawned the need for many standards organizations, clubs and societies of both a formal and informal nature.</blockquote>
