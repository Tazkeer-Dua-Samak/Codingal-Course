        <h1 align="center">Roller Skating as a Hobby</h1><hr><br>
        <p>As far as I am concerned, the best and most entertaining hobby is roller-skating. 
            It had made me very curious and I wanted to learn more about it. In the beginning, I 
            wore a helmet, arm and knee guards to make sure I don't injure myself too badly. Before I got the hang of it, I was often 
            out of control. But I practiced and improved 
            quickly. In the early morning, I would go to the park near our house with my father 
            and sister, where our father taught us how to skate. I found it easy and was a quick 
            learner. After learning how to skate, me and my sibling taught three of our cousins and they learnt it too. 
            I think it is a very interesting hobby. It gives pleasure and stirs up emotions. It strengthens muscles 
            and is energizing and exciting. That is why I adore 
            skating so much. I 
            never get tired or bored while skating. On the contrary, I feel really well.<br> For those starting from 
            scratch, helmets etc. are a must. Roller-skating requires balance and courage. To start 
            with, even I was afraid I might fall and hurt myself badly, but I gradually learnt 
            with my fatherâ€™s help. I had to learn how to control myself. My advice to anyone who 
            has never roller-skated, is to try it at least once. You are <b>bound</b> to like it.
