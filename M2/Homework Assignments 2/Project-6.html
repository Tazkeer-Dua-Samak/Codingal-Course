        <h4 align="center">This New Drug Turns Human Blood into Mosquito Killer</h4>
        <p>Recent research has revealed that nitisinone, a drug originally used to treat rare genetic conditions, 
            can fatally disrupt a mosquito’s digestion process after it feeds on human blood containing the substance. 
            According to Science Alert and the University of Notre Dame, the key lies in the drug’s ability to block a vital 
            enzyme in mosquitoes called <b>4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD)</b>.<br></p>
            <h4>Advantages Over Traditional Methods</h4>
           <p> Nitisinone offers several benefits that position it as a standout in mosquito control. It works faster than 
           existing alternatives like ivermectin, killing mosquitoes within a day of ingestion. Furthermore, it remains active 
           in the bloodstream for extended periods, allowing for long-lasting protection.
            <br>
            It affects mosquitoes of all ages, including older ones that are more likely to transmit malaria. The drug’s ability 
            to eliminate both insecticide-susceptible and resistant strains is a big feat for combating malaria-transmitting 
            mosquito species which have wreaked havoc in the past few decades across various countries in Asia.</p>
            <h4>Potential Impact on Malaria Control</h4>
            <p>The implications for malaria prevention are significant. By turning human blood into a vector control tool, nitisinone 
                introduces a unique and powerful way to reduce mosquito populations.<br>
            Lee R. Haines, an associate research professor at the University of Notre Dame, believes the drug could be a “promising new 
            complementary tool for controlling insect-borne diseases like malaria.” Its ability to target resistant mosquito strains and 
            older vectors makes it especially useful in regions where conventional interventions are losing effectiveness.</p>
