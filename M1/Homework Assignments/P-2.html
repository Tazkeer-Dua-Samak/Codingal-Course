          <p>College life is a unique and transformative phase that shapes our personalities and prepares us for the future. <del><strong><em>LIES!</em></strong></del>
            <br> I am proud to be a student at <b><i><q>Punjab College</q></i></b>, a place known for its <i>excellent academics and
             vibrant campus life</i>. It is of <b>Lahore Board</b>, a part of Punjab Board. My college offers a wide range of courses, including 
            <mark> arts, science, and commerce</mark>, ensuring
              that students can pursue their passions. There are <sup>(almost)</sup> 2000 students in my college.The faculty members are highly qualified and supportive, always
               encouraging us to think critically and aim high.<br> In addition to academics, there are many extracurricular
                activities like <q><mark>sports, music, and debate clubs</mark></q> <small><del><i><sub>yeah right</sub></i></del></small> that help students develop their skills and confidence.
            <br> The college campus is well-equipped with modern facilities such as spacious classrooms, a library with thousands
              of books, computer labs, and sports grounds. One of my favorite spots is the college library, where I can
               explore books on diverse topics and enhance my knowledge.
             <br>Every year, our college organizes cultural and technical fests that attract students from other institutions. 
             These events are not only entertaining but also give us opportunities to showcase our talents and network with peers.
             <br>Beyond academics, my college places a strong emphasis on community service and environmental conservation. 
             We participate in tree-planting drives and cleanliness campaigns, which instill a sense of responsibility towards 
             society and nature.
             <br>The memories I create here with my friends and teachers will stay with me forever. My college is not just a place of
              learning; it is <del>hell</del><b> a home</b> where I am growing into a confident and capable individual.</p>
