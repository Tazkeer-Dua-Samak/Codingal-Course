        <p>Baking is a method of preparing food that uses dry heat, typically in an oven, but can also be done in hot <b style="color: rgb(126, 113, 90);">ashes</b>, or on hot stones.</p> 
            <p id="bread">The most common baked item is bread, but many other types of foods can be baked.</p>
           <br><h2 align="center">~: Process :~</h2> Heat is gradually transferred from the surface 
            of cakes, cookies, and pieces of bread to their center, typically conducted at elevated temperatures surpassing 300Â°F. Dry heat 
            cooking imparts a distinctive richness to foods through the processes of caramelization and surface browning. As heat travels 
            through, it transforms batters and doughs into baked goods and more with a firm dry crust and a softer center.
            <h3 align="center">~: Baking and Barbecue :~</h3> Baking can be 
            combined with <b class="grill">grilling</b> to produce a hybrid barbecue variant by using both methods simultaneously, or one after the other. Baking 
            is related to barbecuing because the concept of the masonry oven is similar to that of a smoke pit.
            <h4 align="center">~: History :~</h4>
            Baking has traditionally been performed at home for day-to-day meals and in bakeries and restaurants for local consumption. When production was industrialized, baking was automated 
            by machines in large factories. The art of baking remains a fundamental skill and is important for nutrition, as baked goods, especially bread, are a common and important food, both 
            from an economic and cultural point of view. <p>A person who prepares baked goods as a profession is called a baker.</p>
