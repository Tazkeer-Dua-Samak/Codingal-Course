        <h1 align="center">Roller Skating as a Hobby</h1><hr><br>
        <p>I have many hobbies like reading, playing badminton, As far as I am concerned, the best and most entertaining hobby is roller-skating. 
            It had made me very curious and I wanted to learn more about it. In the beginning, I 
            wore a helmet, arm and knee guards to make sure I don't injure myself too badly. Before I got the hang of it, I was often 
            out of control. But I practiced and improved 
            quickly. In the early morning, I would go to the park near our house with my father 
            and sister, where our father taught us how to skate. I found it easy and was a quick 
            learner. After learning how to skate, me and my sibling taught three of our cousins and they learnt it too. 
            I think it is a very interesting hobby. It gives pleasure and stirs up emotions. It strengthens muscles 
            and is energizing and exciting. As proven by a research,
            <p class="box" align="center"> According to a study conducted at the University of Massachusetts, skating causes less than 50 percent of the impact shock to joints compared to running. In other words, an aerobic roller skating workout has the same benefit as the same amount of time spent jogging, only without the joint damage.</p>

            <p>Skating creates many beautiful memories and are a great family bonding activity, that is why I adore 
                skating so much. I 
                never get tired or bored while skating. On the contrary, I feel really well.<br> For those starting from 
                scratch, necessary protective gear like helmets, etc. are a must. Roller-skating requires balance and courage. To start 
                with, even I was afraid I might fall and hurt myself badly, and I did fall numerous times but I picked myself back up and kept trying. I had to learn how to control myself. My advice to anyone who has never roller-skated, is to try it at least once. You are <b>bound</b> to like it.
